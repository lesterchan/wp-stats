Display your WordPress blog statistics. Ranging from general total statistics, some of my plugins statistics and top 10 statistics.

## Description

### Usage (Create Stats Page)
1. Go to 'WP-Admin -> Pages -> Add New'
2. Type any title you like in the page's title area
3. If you ARE using nice permalinks, after typing the title, WordPress will generate the permalink to the page. You will see an 'Edit' link just beside the permalink.
4. Click 'Edit' and type in 'stats' in the text field (without the quotes) and click 'Save'.
5. Type `[page_stats]` in the page's content area
6. Click 'Publish'
7. If you ARE NOT using nice permalinks, you need to go to `WP-Admin -> Settings -> Stats` and under 'Stats URL', you need to fill in the URL to the Stats Page you created above.

### Usage (With Widget)
1. Go to `WP-Admin -> Appearance -> Widgets`
2. The widget name is `Stats`.
